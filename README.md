# PokemonAPI
First project for PCA 

## Instructions
Fork and clone this repository to your terminal.
Open index.HTML in your terminal
In the search bar, type in the name of your favorite Pokemon
Once the Pokemon's picture and name appear, click on the picture to pull up the abilities. 
If you like the Pokemon, click on the like button to show your love!

## Deliverables
This application is designed to utilize a simple search bar to allow the end user to look up Pokemon and their related abilities while also adding the ability to, "like" a Pokemon through the like button.

1. The `index.html` file has a form with a search input. When the form is submitted, it should take the value of the input and search the, "PokeAPI" for user matches using the [User Search Endpoint](#https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${name}). This should pull up a Pokemon image and also their name.

2. Clicking on the Pokemon's image will allow the user to pull up the Pokemon's special passive abilities.

3. There is also a like button implemented on the page, clicking this like button will increase the amount of likes to this, "like button".
