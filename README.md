# PokemonAPI
First project for PCA 

## Deliverables
This application is designed to utilize a simple search bar to allow the end user to look up Pokemon and their related stats from all generations of games...

1. The `index.html` file has a form with a search input. When the form is submitted, it should take the value of the input and search GitHub for user matches using the [User Search Endpoint](#https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${name}). This should pull up a Pokemon image and also their name.

2. Clicking on the Pokemon's name will allow the user to pull up the Pokemon's special passive abilities.

3. There is also a like button implemented on the page, clicking this like button will increase the amount of likes to this like button.
